# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Supervised Machine Learning

# Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to build a supervised machine learning model to look into credit card risk from a LendingClub dataset. By using an oversample model and an undersampling model I compared the two models to predict credit risk and then evaluate the performance of the two models and give my recommendation on whether the models should be used in fact to predict credit risk. 

# Results
The results for the oversampling machine learning models are shown in the screenshot here. ![Credit_resampling_models](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100726716/181362052-b2b74763-4ce1-49c5-80e4-a06dab72cf63.png)
 - The Balanced Acuracy Score = 1. 
 - The array for the confusion matrix is [149, 0][0, 16] 
 
 The results for the undersampling machine learning models are shown in the screenshot here. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100726716/181362477-9fdba122-f953-4dbb-abdb-2df12977cf04.png)
- The Balanced Accuracy score is .657.
- The confusion matrix array is [29, 63][20, 17083]. 

# Summary 
To summarize, based on my models, the oversampling machine learning model shows the best accuracy in determining credit card risk. The balance score for the oversampling model is 1 as opposed to the .657 score for the undersampling model.
